# Sorting


## Bubble Sort

This is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It can be implemented in just a few lines.

```python
def bubble_sort(values):
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if values[i] > values[j]:
                values[i], values[j] = values[j], values[i]
```


The process can be visualized like this:

## Quick Sort

This is a more complex algorithm, but it runs faster. It works by recursively _pivoting_ the data:
1. Define a start/end range (grey) 
2. Pick an pivot value within the range (orange)
3. Move everything smaller than the pivot left of the pivot (red is active swap)
4. Move everything greater to the right.
5. The left recursive problem is the values smaller than the pivot
6. The right recursive problem is the values greater than the pivot

```python
def quicksort_inplace(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        # Partition the array and get the pivot index
        pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high)
        # Recursively sort elements before and after the pivot
        quicksort_inplace(arr, low, pivot_index - 1)
        quicksort_inplace(arr, pivot_index + 1, high)

def partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]  # Choose the last element as the pivot
    i = low - 1        # Pointer for the smaller element

    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            i += 1
            # Swap elements to place smaller elements on the left
            if i != j:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]    

    # Swap the pivot element to its correct position
    if i+1 != high:
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    
    return i + 1

quicksort_inplace(values, 0, len(values) - 1)

```


The process can be visualized like this:
