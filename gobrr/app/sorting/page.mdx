# Sorting


## Bubble Sort

This is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It can be implemented in just a few lines.

```python
def bubble_sort(values):
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if values[i] > values[j]:
                values[i], values[j] = values[j], values[i]
```


The process can be visualized like this:
